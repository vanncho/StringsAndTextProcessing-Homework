Homework: Strings and Text Processing
<strong>Problem 1. Strings in C#.</strong>

Describe the strings in C#.
What is typical for the string data type?
Describe the most important methods of the String class.
Problem 2. Reverse string

Write a program that reads a string, reverses it and prints the result at the console.
Example:

input	output
sample	elpmas
Problem 3. Correct brackets

Write a program to check if in a given expression the brackets are put correctly.
Example of correct expression: ((a+b)/5-d). Example of incorrect expression: )(a+b)).

Problem 4. Sub-string in text

Write a program that finds how many times a sub-string is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).
Example:

The target sub-string is in

The text is as follows: We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.

The result is: 9

Problem 5. Parse tags

You are given a text. Write a program that changes the text in all regions surrounded by the tags <upcase> and </upcase> to upper-case.
The tags cannot be nested.
Example: We are living in a <upcase>yellow submarine</upcase>. We don't have <upcase>anything</upcase> else.

The expected result: We are living in a YELLOW SUBMARINE. We don't have ANYTHING else.

Problem 6. String length

Write a program that reads from the console a string of maximum 20 characters. If the length of the string is less than 20, the rest of the characters should be filled with *.
Print the result string into the console.
Problem 7. Encode/decode

Write a program that encodes and decodes a string using given encryption key (cipher).
The key consists of a sequence of characters.
The encoding/decoding is done by performing XOR (exclusive or) operation over the first letter of the string with the first of the key, the second � with the second, etc. When the last key character is reached, the next is the first.
Problem 8. Extract sentences

Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.
Example:

The word is: in

The text is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.

The expected result is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We will move out of it in 5 days.

Consider that the sentences are separated by . and the words � by non-letter symbols.

Problem 9. Forbidden words

We are given a string containing a list of forbidden words and a text containing some of these words.
Write a program that replaces the forbidden words with asterisks.
Example text: Microsoft announced its next generation PHP compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is implemented as a dynamic language in CLR.

Forbidden words: PHP, CLR, Microsoft

The expected result: ********* announced its next generation *** compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is implemented as a dynamic language in ***.

Problem 10. Unicode characters

Write a program that converts a string to a sequence of C# Unicode character literals.
Use format strings.
Example:

input	output
Hi!	\u0048\u0069\u0021
Problem 11. Format number

Write a program that reads a number and prints it as a decimal number, hexadecimal number, percentage and in scientific notation.
Format the output aligned right in 15 symbols.
Problem 12. Parse URL

Write a program that parses an URL address given in the format: [protocol]://[server]/[resource] and extracts from it the [protocol], [server] and [resource] elements.
Example:

URL	Information
http://telerikacademy.com/Courses/Courses/Details/212	[protocol] = http 
[server] = telerikacademy.com 
[resource] = /Courses/Courses/Details/212
Problem 13. Reverse sentence

Write a program that reverses the words in given sentence.
Example:

input	output
C# is not C++, not PHP and not Delphi!	Delphi not and PHP, not C++ not is C#!
Problem 14. Word dictionary

A dictionary is stored as a sequence of text lines containing words and their explanations.
Write a program that enters a word and translates it by using the dictionary.
Sample dictionary:

input	output
.NET	platform for applications from Microsoft
CLR	managed execution environment for .NET
namespace	hierarchical organization of classes
Problem 15. Replace tags

Write a program that replaces in a HTML document given as string all the tags <a href="�">�</a> with corresponding tags [URL=�]�/URL].
Example:

input	output
